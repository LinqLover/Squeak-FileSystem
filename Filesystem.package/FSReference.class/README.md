I combine a filesystem and path, which is sufficient to refer to a concrete file or directory. I provide methods for navigating my filesystem, performing filesystem operations and opening and closing files.  I am the primary mechanism for working with files and directories. 

With FSFilesystem I'm the class of choice to get started.
