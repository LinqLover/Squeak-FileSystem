I'm a private and abstract filesystem path, independent of the string representation used to describe paths on a specific filesystem. I provide methods for navigating the filesystem hierarchy and working with absolute and relative paths. I only refer to a concrete file or directory with regard to a specific filesystem. Normally users should not use me directly. 

Path independent representation of delimiter is defined by FSDiskFilesystem current delimiter
